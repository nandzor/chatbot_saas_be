## 🔄 Data Flow Architecture

### Request Flow
```
1. Client Request → Load Balancer
2. Load Balancer → FrankenPHP Instance
3. FrankenPHP → Laravel Router
4. Router → Middleware Chain
5. Middleware → Controller
6. Controller → Service Layer
7. Service → Model/Database
8. Response ← Controller ← Service
9. Client ← Load Balancer ← FrankenPHP
```

### Queue Processing Flow
```
1. Controller → Dispatch Job → RabbitMQ
2. Queue Worker → Consume Job → Execute
3. Job → Service Layer → Database
4. Success/Failure → Log → Monitoring
```

### Event Flow
```
1. Service Action → Event Dispatch
2. Event → Registered Listeners
3. Listeners → Background Jobs
4. Jobs → External Services (Email, etc.)
```

## 🏗️ Component Architecture

  - Memory limit: 512MB per worker
  - Request timeout: 30s
  - Keep-alive: Enabled
```

### PostgreSQL Database
```yaml
Configuration:
  - Version: 16
  - Connection pool: 20 connections
  - Shared buffers: 256MB
  - Work memory: 4MB

Optimization:
  - Indexes on frequently queried columns
  - Read replicas for read-heavy operations
  - Connection pooling via PgBouncer
  - Regular VACUUM and ANALYZE
```

### Redis Cache
```yaml
Usage Patterns:
  - Application cache (Laravel cache)
  - Session storage
  - Rate limiting counters
  - Queue job data

Configuration:
  - Memory: 256MB
  - Eviction policy: allkeys-lru
  - Persistence: AOF + RDB
  - Replication: Master-slave setup
```

### RabbitMQ Message Broker
```yaml
Queue Types:
  - high_priority: Critical operations
  - default: Standard processing
  - notifications: Email/SMS
  - low_priority: Cleanup tasks

Configuration:
  - Memory limit: 40% of system RAM
  - Disk limit: 1GB
  - Message TTL: 1 hour
  - Dead letter exchange: enabled
```

## 🔒 Security Architecture

### Authentication Flow
```
1. User Login → Validate Credentials
2. Generate JWT Token → Store in Sanctum
3. Include Token in API Requests
4. Middleware Validates Token
5. Attach User to Request Context
```

### Authorization Layers
```
1. Route Middleware → Basic auth check
2. Controller Gates → Feature access
3. Service Policies → Resource access
4. Model Scopes → Data filtering
```
